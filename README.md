### 26.10.2020-01.11.2020

###### Read the article
-------------
* Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf
  * How cost functions of a Federated Learning differs from normal ML cost functions
  * Federated Averaging (FedAvg) Algorithm 
  * System heterogenity and ways to tackle this problem (FedProx algorithm, weighted averaging) 
###### Followed the Tutorials
--------------
* Federated Learning for Image Classification https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification
* Custom Federated Algorithms, Part 2: Implementing Federated Averaging https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/custom_federated_algorithms_2

###### Plans for the Upcoming Week
----------------

* I'm planning on getting more Familiar with TensorFlow by watching tutorials and making small models.
* After learning more about TensorFlow, I'm planning on familiarizing myself more with Tensor Flow Federated and making the model for MNIST (or maybe CIFAR) image classification from scratch.
* I'm planning on reading more articles about Federated Learning.
###### 03.11.2020 - 09.11.2020 Done
----------------
* Learned aobut TensorFlow and TensorFlow Federated
* Worked on basic CIFAR10 model: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NFW_YXpptkM6O0lZ-xQN-PE7DOjo1k2M#scrollTo=DFSsHIeEV9k8

###### Plans for the upcoming week
-------------------
* Search for Covid-19 Databases that can be used. 
  * https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10401.pdf
* Read at least 3 papers about Federated Learning
* Practice more with tensor flow federated:  
  * with more complex models
  * with different datasets
  
  ###### 09.11.2020 - 16.11.2020 Done
----------------
* Implemented a Client Server architecture from scratch using keras, tf and python.
* Briefly searched for databases that could be used for the project: Federated Learning for Covid-19.
  * https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10401.pdf

###### Plans for the upcoming week
-------------------
* Implement a deeper model using ResNet or similar architecture.
* Learn more about TFF since the client-server architecture I implemented has overhead when distributing the model weights and reduces speed.
* Literature scan for `layer specific training` using Federated Learning.

###### 16.11.2020 - 23.11.2020
--------------------------------------
* Read the paper : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339880491_Averaging_Is_Probably_Not_the_Optimum_Way_of_Aggregating_Parameters_in_Federated_Learning/fulltext/5e6a2cde92851c20f322812c/Averaging-Is-Probably-Not-the-Optimum-Way-of-Aggregating-Parameters-in-Federated-Learning.pdf
* Read the paper : 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06641.pdf
* Tried to get more insight about using TensorFlow Federated
