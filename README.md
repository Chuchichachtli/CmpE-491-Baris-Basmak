###### Plans for the Upcoming Week
----------------

* I'm planning on getting more Familiar with TensorFlow by watching tutorials and making small models.
* After learning more about TensorFlow, I'm planning on familiarizing myself more with Tensor Flow Federated and making the model for MNIST (or maybe CIFAR) image classification from scratch.
* I'm planning on reading more articles about Federated Learning.
